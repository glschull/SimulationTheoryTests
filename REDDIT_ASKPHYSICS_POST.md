## üìù **Your r/AskPhysics Post**

### **Title: "How to analyze correlations across independent physics datasets without introducing systematic bias?"**

### **Post Content:**

```
I'm working on a statistical analysis project involving multiple physics datasets and would appreciate methodological guidance from the community.

**The Question**: What's the best approach for detecting correlations across completely independent physics domains while avoiding false discoveries and systematic bias?

**Context**: I'm analyzing public data from different physics experiments to look for unexpected statistical dependencies using information theory methods.

**Datasets**:
- Planck CMB temperature data (2M+ measurements)
- LIGO gravitational wave detections (5 events)
- Pierre Auger cosmic ray events (5K detections)
- IceCube neutrino events (1K detections)  
- LHC particle collision data (50K events)
- Astronomical survey data (100K+ objects)

**Current Method**:
- Cross-domain mutual information analysis
- Bootstrap confidence intervals (1000 iterations)
- False discovery rate control for multiple comparisons
- Conservative significance thresholds (p < 0.001)

**Unexpected Result**: Finding statistically significant correlations (1.2-2.9 bits mutual information) between domains that should be physically independent.

**My Questions**:
1. What statistical controls should I add for this type of cross-domain analysis?
2. How do I distinguish real physical correlations from systematic measurement artifacts?
3. Are there better approaches than mutual information for heterogeneous physics data?
4. What are the most likely sources of false correlations in multi-domain analysis?

**Background**: I'm self-taught in this area (1 college physics course) but have been learning statistics and data analysis to pursue this question. 

Any guidance on improving the statistical rigor of this approach would be greatly appreciated!

## üîÑ **Expected Responses & How to Engage**

### **Likely Community Responses:**

#### **"This sounds like data mining - how do you control for multiple hypothesis testing?"**
**Your Response**: "Excellent point! I've been using FDR correction (Benjamini-Hochberg), but you're right that this is a major concern. What additional controls would you recommend for exploratory analysis across this many domains?"

#### **"Different experiments have different systematic errors - how do you account for that?"**
**Your Response**: "That's exactly what I'm worried about! I'm not sure how to properly control for systematic effects that might be common across different experimental setups. Could you suggest approaches for identifying and controlling for these?"

#### **"Your sample sizes are very different - from 5 events to 2M measurements. How do you handle that?"**
**Your Response**: "This has been one of my biggest challenges! I've been trying different normalization approaches, but I'm not confident I'm handling the scale differences properly. What's the standard approach in physics for comparing datasets with such different sample sizes?"

#### **"What physical mechanism could explain correlations between these domains?"**
**Your Response**: "That's the key question! These domains should be completely independent according to standard physics. Either I'm seeing systematic artifacts (most likely), or there's some unknown physics connection. How would you approach distinguishing between these possibilities?"

#### **"Have you tried simulated data to test your method?"**
**Your Response**: "Great suggestion! I haven't done that yet - could you elaborate on how I should set up simulated datasets to test whether my method produces false correlations?"
