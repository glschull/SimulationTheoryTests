# Simulation Theory Test Kit

This is an open framework designed to explore testable predictions derived from the hypothesis that our universe may be a computational simulation.

## Included Tests
- Quantum collapse behavior under observation (proxy simulation)
- Planck-scale discreteness scanning (using sample data)
- Compression ratios of physical constants
- Bayesian anomaly scoring on observed distributions

## Goals
- Encourage scientific inquiry of metaphysical claims
- Build data-backed artifacts that either support or weaken simulation-based explanations
- Incorporate real datasets for deeper analysis

## Contributing
- Place real or simulated datasets in the `/data` directory
- Submit new test scripts under `/tests`

# Simulation Manifesto

We assert that certain observable signatures may emerge if our universe is the result of a computational process. This framework seeks to:

1. Formalize the Simulation Hypothesis as a testable scientific model.
2. Define falsifiable traits that distinguish computational reality from ontological reality.
3. Collect evidence that either challenges or reinforces these traits.
4. Maintain philosophical neutrality while prioritizing empirical rigor.

This is not a claim that we *are* in a simulation, but that we can meaningfully explore the hypothesis like any other scientific model.

# Simulation Hypothesis (Formal Draft)

## Hypothesis Statement
"The observable universe operates in a way that is best explained by a finite, computational substrate with artificial constraints."

## Scientific Conditions
- Must make testable predictions.
- Must be distinguishable from base physical realism.
- Must yield differing statistical artifacts from what is expected under non-simulated models.

## Observable Markers
- Quantized spacetime
- Optimized encoding of constants
- Non-local quantum information collapse
- Finite energy/processing caps

## Suggested Investigations
- Bayesian anomaly scoring
- Compression analysis of fundamental constants
- Search for Planck-scale discreteness

## Status
ACTIVE — Seeking contributions, experiments, debate.
