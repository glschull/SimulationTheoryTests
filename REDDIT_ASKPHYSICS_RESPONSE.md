## 📋 **Your Thoughtful Response:**

```
Thanks for pointing this out - you're absolutely right about the multiple testing problem. 

I'm testing 21 domain pairs (7 choose 2), so even with my current p < 0.001 threshold, I could definitely be seeing false positives. The sample size issue is also huge - comparing 5 LIGO events to 2M CMB measurements feels problematic.

Quick question: when you mention "correctly analyzing the sample statistics" - are you thinking about bootstrap resampling or something else? I've been using z-scores but suspect that's not appropriate given the different sample sizes.

For the multiple testing, should I be looking at Bonferroni correction instead of FDR? Or is there a better approach for exploratory analysis like this?

This is exactly the kind of feedback I was hoping for - thanks for taking the time.
