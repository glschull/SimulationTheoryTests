## 🛠️ **TROUBLESHOOTING**

### **If Post Gets Downvoted**
1. **Stay calm** - this is normal for controversial topics
2. **Respond professionally** to criticism
3. **Clarify misconceptions** about methodology

## 📝 **PRE-WRITTEN RESPONSES**

### **Response to "This is Pseudoscience"**
```
I understand the concern - the simulation hypothesis has been associated with non-scientific speculation. However, this work uses standard statistical and ML techniques applied to real observational data. The methodology is designed to be falsifiable with clear predictions about computational signatures. Whether the results support or refute the hypothesis, the framework itself advances empirical testing of fundamental questions. All code and data are open for reproduction and criticism.
```

### **Response to "Unfalsifiable"**
```
Actually, the framework makes several falsifiable predictions: (1) Computational realities should show cross-domain correlations due to resource sharing, (2) Discreteness should appear at fundamental scales, (3) Information compression signatures should be detectable. A null result (suspicion score near 0) would strongly support non-computational reality. The moderate score (0.486) requires explanation either way.
```

### **Response to "Cherry-Picking Data"**
```
I used all available data from major physics collaborations - no selective sampling. The datasets span 7 independent domains chosen before analysis began. The statistical methods include multiple comparison corrections and conservative significance thresholds. If you see specific selection biases, please point them out - improving the methodology is the goal.
