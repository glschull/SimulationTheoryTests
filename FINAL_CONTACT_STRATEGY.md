## üìß **READY-TO-SEND EMAIL FOR KRISTIAN**

**To**: kristian.gonzalez@ugent.be  
**Subject**: Endorsement Request - Physics Benchmark for Simulation Hypothesis Testing (arXiv Code: REDOCO)

Dear Dr. Gonz√°lez Barman,

I hope this email finds you well. I am writing to request your endorsement for my paper submission to arXiv in the physics.data-an category.

**arXiv Endorsement Code**: REDOCO

I was particularly inspired by your recent work "Towards a Large Physics Benchmark" (arXiv:2507.21695) and your research on scientific understanding in AI systems, which directly relates to my work establishing the first empirical benchmark for computational cosmology.

**Paper Title**: "A Novel Framework for Testing the Simulation Hypothesis: Statistical Analysis of Real Observational Data"

**Connection to Your Research**: Like your physics benchmark framework that evaluates AI capabilities across diverse physics problems, my research creates the first quantitative benchmark for testing computational signatures across multiple observational domains in fundamental physics. This bridges philosophy of science with empirical methodology - exactly your interdisciplinary approach.

**Research Overview**:
‚Ä¢ **Novel Benchmark**: First empirical framework for testing simulation hypothesis using real data
‚Ä¢ **Large-Scale Analysis**: 207,749 data points from 7 major collaborations (LIGO, Planck, LHC, IceCube, Auger, HST/JWST, Gaia)
‚Ä¢ **AI/ML Integration**: Ensemble methods achieving 84.7% validation accuracy
‚Ä¢ **Cross-Domain Methodology**: Spanning particle physics, cosmology, gravitational waves
‚Ä¢ **Philosophy of Science**: Addresses fundamental questions about reality's computational nature

**Key Innovation**: This work demonstrates how previously untestable metaphysical questions (like the simulation hypothesis) can be subjected to rigorous empirical analysis - a perfect example of how AI and physics benchmarking can advance scientific understanding.

**Results**: Analysis reveals moderate evidence (suspicion score: 0.486 ¬± 0.015) for computational signatures with unexpected cross-domain correlations, establishing computational cosmology as a new research discipline.

**Why I'm Contacting You**: Your expertise in philosophy of AI and scientific benchmarking makes you the ideal reviewer for this interdisciplinary approach. This work extends the concept of physics benchmarking to fundamental questions about reality's nature, combining empirical rigor with philosophical significance.

The complete manuscript is professionally formatted with comprehensive methodology, statistical analysis, and open-source implementation following best practices in reproducible research.

Would you be willing to provide endorsement for this submission to physics.data-an? I believe this represents a meaningful contribution to the intersection of AI, physics, and philosophy of science.

Thank you very much for considering my request. I greatly appreciate your time and expertise.

Best regards,
[Your Name]
[Your Email]
