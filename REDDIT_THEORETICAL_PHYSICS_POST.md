# üö® r/TheoreticalPhysics - REVISED Strategy (Based on Rules)

## ‚ö†Ô∏è **IMPORTANT: Community Guidelines Analysis**

### **Their Rules:**
- **"Professional or amateur self-theories and models are not welcome"** ‚ùå
- **"Post and discuss external content related to advanced research"** 
- **"Back up posts with reliable information, clear argumentation and verifiable sources"**
- **"This sub does not fear maths, so mathematical physics discussions are appreciated"**
- **"Beware to post if you do not know what a Lagrangian is"** ‚ö†Ô∏è

### **Reality Check:**
Your project would likely be seen as an "amateur self-theory" and removed. This community wants:
- **External research** (not your own work)
- **Advanced mathematical physics** (Lagrangians, field theory, etc.)
- **Professional academic content**
- **Published papers** for discussion

## üéØ **Better Alternative Communities**

### **1. r/AskPhysics** (Much Better Fit)
- **Open to questions** about methodology
- **Welcomes learning discussions**
- **No karma requirements**
- **Less gatekeeping**

**Approach**: "How would you analyze correlations across different physics domains?"

### **2. r/PhysicsStudents** (Perfect for Self-Taught)
- **Educational focus**
- **Welcomes learning journeys**
- **Supportive community**
- **No formal requirements**

**Approach**: "Self-taught analysis of physics datasets - looking for feedback"

### **3. r/AskScienceDiscussion** (Ideal for Your Project)
- **Open scientific discussion**
- **Welcomes speculative but rigorous work**
- **No credential requirements**
- **Loves methodology discussions**

**Approach**: "Cross-domain analysis in physics data - methodology discussion"

### **4. r/datascience** (After Building Karma)
- **Methodology focus**
- **Loves novel approaches**
- **Technical community**
- **Real-world applications**

## üìù **Revised Posting Strategy**

### **IMMEDIATE RECOMMENDATION: Try r/AskScienceDiscussion**

#### **Title: "Methodology for detecting correlations across independent physics domains - statistical analysis approach"**

#### **Post Content:**
```
I've been working on a methodology question that I'd love the community's input on.

**The Challenge**: How do you rigorously test for statistical dependencies between completely independent physics datasets without introducing bias?

**Context**: I'm analyzing public data from different physics experiments (Planck CMB, LIGO gravitational waves, Pierre Auger cosmic rays, etc.) to look for unexpected correlations using information theory.

**Methodology**:
- Cross-domain mutual information analysis
- Bootstrap confidence intervals (1000 iterations)
- False discovery rate control for multiple comparisons
- Conservative significance thresholds (p < 0.001)

**Finding**: Statistically significant correlations (1.2-2.9 bits mutual information) between domains that should be independent.

**Questions**:
1. What statistical controls am I missing for this type of analysis?
2. Are there better approaches for cross-domain correlation detection?
3. How do you validate results when you don't have ground truth?
4. What systematic effects should I be most concerned about?

**Background**: I'm self-taught in this area, so I'm particularly interested in methodological feedback from those with more experience in multi-domain scientific analysis.

Any suggestions for improving the statistical rigor of this approach?

### **Why r/AskScienceDiscussion Works Better:**
- **Methodology focused** rather than theory-building
- **Asking for help** rather than proposing new theories
- **Open to self-taught researchers**
- **Loves statistical/methodological discussions**
- **No "Lagrangian" gatekeeping**

## üéØ **Alternative Communities (Ranked by Fit)**

### **1. r/AskScienceDiscussion** ‚≠ê **BEST OPTION**
- **Perfect for methodology questions**
- **Welcomes self-taught researchers**
- **Open scientific discussion**
- **No gatekeeping about credentials**

### **2. r/AskPhysics** ‚≠ê **EXCELLENT OPTION**
- **Question-based format**
- **Educational focus**
- **Helpful community**
- **No karma requirements**

### **3. r/PhysicsStudents** ‚≠ê **GREAT FOR LEARNING**
- **Supportive environment**
- **Educational discussions**
- **Self-taught friendly**
- **Less intimidating**

### **4. r/statistics** (After Some Karma)
- **Methodology focused**
- **Loves novel statistical approaches**
- **Technical discussions**
- **Practical applications**

## üöÄ **Immediate Action Plan**

### **Skip r/TheoreticalPhysics** - Go to r/AskScienceDiscussion instead

**Why**: They want external research papers and advanced mathematical physics. Your self-taught project would be seen as "amateur self-theory" and removed.

**Better Strategy**: Frame as methodology question seeking community expertise rather than proposing new theory.
