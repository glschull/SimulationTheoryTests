## 📊 Test Descriptions

### 1. Quantum Observer Effect Tests
Simulates double-slit experiments with varying observer probabilities to detect statistical anomalies that might indicate computational optimization or artificial constraints.

**Key Metrics:**
- Collapse rate vs. observer probability correlation
- Chi-square randomness tests
- Interference pattern analysis
- Anomaly detection scoring

### 2. Planck-Scale Discreteness Analysis
Analyzes timing and spatial data for evidence of fundamental quantization that might suggest a computational grid underlying spacetime.

**Key Metrics:**
- Interval difference distributions
- Power spectrum analysis for periodic artifacts
- Entropy measurements
- Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests against continuous distributions

### 3. Physical Constants Compression Analysis
Tests whether fundamental physical constants can be compressed more than expected, which might indicate they were programmed rather than naturally occurring.

**Key Metrics:**
- Multi-algorithm compression ratios (zlib, bz2, lzma)
- Mathematical relationship precision analysis
- Cross-constant correlation studies
- Digital signature detection in constant representations

### 4. CMB Pattern Recognition
Scans cosmic microwave background data for artificial signatures, hidden messages, or computational artifacts that wouldn't occur in natural data.

**Key Metrics:**
- Hash pattern analysis for programmer signatures
- Statistical deviation from expected CMB properties
- Power spectrum anomaly detection
- Autocorrelation analysis

### 5. Comprehensive Bayesian Analysis
Combines evidence from all tests using Bayesian inference to estimate the probability that observed patterns indicate computational reality.

**Key Outputs:**
- Overall simulation probability estimate
- Confidence intervals and uncertainty quantification
- Evidence weighting and sensitivity analysis
- Cross-dataset mutual information analysis

## 📈 Interpreting Results

### Anomaly Scores
- **0.0 - 0.2:** Minimal computational signatures detected
- **0.2 - 0.4:** Weak evidence of artificial constraints
- **0.4 - 0.6:** Moderate computational signatures present
- **0.6 - 0.8:** Strong evidence of digital artifacts
- **0.8 - 1.0:** Highly suspicious computational patterns

### Statistical Significance
- **p < 0.001:** Highly significant deviation from expected natural patterns
- **p < 0.01:** Significant evidence of non-random structure
- **p < 0.05:** Modest evidence of artificial constraints
- **p > 0.05:** Results consistent with natural processes

## 🎯 Goals & Philosophy

- **Scientific Rigor:** Apply proper statistical methods and hypothesis testing
- **Falsifiability:** Design tests that could potentially disprove the simulation hypothesis
- **Transparency:** Open source methodology for peer review and improvement
- **Objectivity:** Let the data guide conclusions, not preconceptions
- **Reproducibility:** Provide tools for others to verify and extend the analysis

## ⚠️ Important Disclaimers

1. **These are exploratory tests**, not definitive proofs for or against the simulation hypothesis
2. **Computational signatures could have natural explanations** due to measurement limitations or unknown physics
3. **The absence of signatures doesn't disprove** the simulation hypothesis - a perfect simulation might leave no traces
4. **Statistical anomalies require careful interpretation** and independent verification
5. **This is a thought experiment and research tool**, not a claim about the nature of reality
