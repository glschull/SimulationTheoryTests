INTERPRETATION:
Minimal computational signatures detected. The data appears largely
consistent with natural physical processes, though some minor anomalies
were observed that warrant further investigation.

‚ö†Ô∏è  DISCLAIMER: This analysis is experimental and should not be considered
    definitive evidence for or against the simulation hypothesis.
