## üìã **ENDORSEMENT EMAIL TEMPLATES**

### **Template for Dr. Massimiliano Zanin (TOP PRIORITY)**

**Subject**: Endorsement Request - Statistical Physics Framework for Simulation Hypothesis Testing (Code: REDOCO)

Dear Dr. Zanin,

I hope this email finds you well. I am writing to request your endorsement for my paper submission to arXiv in the physics.data-an category.

**Endorsement Code**: REDOCO

I was particularly drawn to your recent work "Beyond Classical Models: Statistical Physics Tools for the Analysis of Time Series in Modern Air Transport" as it shares methodological similarities with my research approach.

**Paper Title**: "A Novel Framework for Testing the Simulation Hypothesis: Statistical Analysis of Real Observational Data"

**Research Alignment**: Like your work applying statistical physics concepts to extract knowledge from macroscale observations, my research applies statistical physics tools to detect potential computational signatures across multiple observational domains.

**Methodology**: I developed a comprehensive framework integrating:
‚Ä¢ Bayesian anomaly detection across 207,749 data points
‚Ä¢ Information-theoretic analysis (mutual information, entropy measures)
‚Ä¢ Cross-domain correlation analysis spanning particle physics to cosmology
‚Ä¢ Statistical physics concepts applied to fundamental questions

**Key Findings**: Analysis reveals moderate evidence (suspicion score: 0.486 ¬± 0.015) for computational signatures, with unexpected cross-domain correlations (0.137-2.918 bits mutual information) suggesting systematic information coupling.

**Scientific Significance**: This work establishes computational cosmology as a new discipline, demonstrating how statistical physics tools can be applied to previously untestable metaphysical questions.

Your expertise in applying statistical physics to complex systems would provide invaluable validation for this interdisciplinary approach.

Would you be willing to provide endorsement for this submission to physics.data-an? I believe this work makes a meaningful contribution to the application of statistical physics in fundamental physics research.

Best regards,
[Your Name]

### **Template for Dr. Sascha Caron**

**Subject**: Endorsement Request - Physics Benchmark for Simulation Hypothesis (Code: REDOCO)

Dear Dr. Caron,

I was inspired by your recent work "Towards a Large Physics Benchmark" and believe you would appreciate the novel benchmarking approach in my research.

**Endorsement Code**: REDOCO

**Paper Title**: "A Novel Framework for Testing the Simulation Hypothesis: Statistical Analysis of Real Observational Data"

**Benchmarking Connection**: Like your physics benchmark framework, my work establishes the first empirical benchmark for testing computational signatures across multiple physics domains.

**Methodology**: 
‚Ä¢ Analysis of 207,749 observations from 7 major collaborations (LIGO, Planck, LHC, etc.)
‚Ä¢ Machine learning validation with 84.7% accuracy
‚Ä¢ Cross-domain statistical analysis spanning particle physics to cosmology
‚Ä¢ Open-source framework for community validation

**Why Relevant**: This creates the first benchmark for computational cosmology, allowing empirical testing of previously untestable hypotheses about reality's nature.

Your experience in developing physics benchmarks would provide excellent perspective for this novel empirical framework.

Would you be willing to endorse this submission to physics.data-an?

### **Template for Dr. Ilya Nemenman**

**Subject**: Endorsement Request - Information Theory in Computational Cosmology (Code: REDOCO)

Dear Dr. Nemenman,

Your work on "Cross and Joint Covariances Enhance Signal Detectability in Undersampled Data" closely aligns with my research approach using information theory for signal detection.

**Endorsement Code**: REDOCO

**Information-Theoretic Alignment**: Like your work on enhancing signal detectability through cross-correlations, my research uses mutual information analysis to detect computational signatures across independent physical domains.

**Key Innovation**: 
‚Ä¢ Cross-domain mutual information analysis (0.137-2.918 bits)
‚Ä¢ Information entropy measures across 207,749 observations
‚Ä¢ Signal detection in undersampled cosmological data
‚Ä¢ Bayesian inference for computational signature probability

**Results**: Detected unexpected information coupling between physically disparate phenomena, suggesting potential computational origins.

Your expertise in information theory and signal detection would provide invaluable validation for this approach.

Would you be willing to endorse this submission to physics.data-an?
