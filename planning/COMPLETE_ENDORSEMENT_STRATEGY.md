**Subject**: Endorsement Request - Physics Benchmark for Simulation Hypothesis Testing (arXiv Code: REDOCO)

Dear Dr. Caron,

I hope this email finds you well. I am writing to request your endorsement for my paper submission to arXiv in the physics.data-an category.

**arXiv Endorsement Code**: REDOCO

I was particularly inspired by your recent work "Towards a Large Physics Benchmark" (arXiv:2507.21695) and your pioneering contributions to data-driven methods in fundamental physics research through the EuCAIF collaboration.

**Paper Title**: "A Novel Framework for Testing the Simulation Hypothesis: Statistical Analysis of Real Observational Data"

**Connection to Your Work**: Like your physics benchmark framework that evaluates AI capabilities across diverse physics problems, my research establishes the first empirical benchmark for testing computational signatures across multiple observational domains in fundamental physics.

**Research Overview**:
‚Ä¢ **Large-Scale Analysis**: 207,749 data points from 7 major collaborations (LIGO, Planck, LHC, IceCube, Auger, HST/JWST, Gaia)
‚Ä¢ **Machine Learning Framework**: Ensemble anomaly detection achieving 84.7% validation accuracy
‚Ä¢ **Cross-Domain Methodology**: Information-theoretic analysis spanning particle physics, cosmology, and gravitational waves
‚Ä¢ **Open Science**: Complete reproducible framework following your approach to collaborative physics research

**Key Innovation**: This creates the first quantitative benchmark for computational cosmology, enabling empirical testing of previously untestable hypotheses about reality's fundamental nature.

**Why I'm Contacting You**: Your expertise in developing physics benchmarks and applying machine learning to fundamental physics makes you an ideal reviewer for this interdisciplinary approach. Your work on data-driven discovery methods directly relates to our systematic search for computational signatures.

**Scientific Significance**: Results show moderate evidence (suspicion score: 0.486 ¬± 0.015) for computational signatures with unexpected cross-domain correlations, establishing computational cosmology as a new research discipline.

The complete manuscript is professionally formatted in LaTeX with comprehensive figures and open-source implementation. All data and methods are publicly available for community validation, following best practices in reproducible research.

Would you be willing to provide endorsement for this submission to physics.data-an? I believe this work makes a meaningful contribution to the intersection of data science and fundamental physics that aligns with your research interests.

Thank you very much for considering my request. I greatly appreciate your time and expertise.

**To**: m.zanin@upm.es  
**Subject**: Endorsement Request - Statistical Physics Framework for Computational Cosmology (arXiv Code: REDOCO)

Dear Dr. Zanin,

I hope this email finds you well. I am writing to request your endorsement for my paper submission to arXiv in the physics.data-an category.

Your recent work "Beyond Classical Models: Statistical Physics Tools for the Analysis of Time Series in Modern Air Transport" (arXiv:2507.20927) demonstrates exactly the type of statistical physics methodology I have applied to fundamental physics questions.

**Paper Title**: "A Novel Framework for Testing the Simulation Hypothesis: Statistical Analysis of Real Observational Data"

**Methodological Alignment**: Like your work applying statistical physics concepts to extract knowledge from macroscale observations in complex systems, my research uses statistical physics tools to detect computational signatures across multiple observational domains in fundamental physics.

**Statistical Physics Framework**:
‚Ä¢ **Information Theory**: Entropy measures, mutual information analysis (0.137-2.918 bits between domains)
‚Ä¢ **Complex Systems Analysis**: Cross-correlation detection in high-dimensional datasets
‚Ä¢ **Time Series Analysis**: Advanced statistical methods for temporal pattern recognition
‚Ä¢ **Bayesian Inference**: Statistical significance testing with proper uncertainty quantification

**Scale and Scope**: Analysis of 207,749 observations spanning:
- Cosmic microwave background fluctuations (Planck)
- Gravitational wave strain data (LIGO)  
- Particle collision events (LHC)
- Cosmic ray observations (Auger)
- Neutrino detection records (IceCube)
- Astronomical surveys (HST, JWST, Gaia)
- Fundamental physical constants (NIST)

**Key Findings**: Statistical analysis reveals unexpected correlations between physically independent phenomena, suggesting potential computational coupling - exactly the type of hidden microscale rules that statistical physics is designed to detect.

**Why Your Expertise is Valuable**: Your experience applying statistical physics to complex systems provides the perfect background to evaluate whether our methodology correctly identifies genuine computational signatures versus statistical artifacts.

The complete manuscript follows rigorous statistical physics principles with comprehensive uncertainty analysis and reproducible methodology.

Would you be willing to provide endorsement for this submission to physics.data-an? I believe this represents a novel application of statistical physics to fundamental questions about reality's nature.

### **Template 3: Dr. Ilya Nemenman (TRY: ilya.nemenman@emory.edu)**

**To**: ilya.nemenman@emory.edu  
**Subject**: Endorsement Request - Information Theory in Computational Cosmology (arXiv Code: REDOCO)

Dear Dr. Nemenman,

I hope this email finds you well. I am writing to request your endorsement for my paper submission to arXiv in the physics.data-an category.

**arXiv Endorsement Code**: REDOCO

Your recent work "Better Together: Cross and Joint Covariances Enhance Signal Detectability in Undersampled Data" (arXiv:2507.22207) demonstrates precisely the information-theoretic approach I have applied to detect computational signatures in cosmological data.

**Paper Title**: "A Novel Framework for Testing the Simulation Hypothesis: Statistical Analysis of Real Observational Data"

**Information-Theoretic Alignment**: Like your work enhancing signal detectability through cross-correlations in undersampled data, my research uses mutual information analysis to detect computational signatures across independent observational domains.

**Information Theory Framework**:
‚Ä¢ **Mutual Information Analysis**: Cross-domain correlation quantification (0.137-2.918 bits)
‚Ä¢ **Signal Detection**: Anomaly identification in high-dimensional, undersampled cosmological datasets
‚Ä¢ **Information Entropy**: Complexity measures across 207,749 observations
‚Ä¢ **Cross-Covariance Methods**: Enhanced detectability through joint analysis of disparate phenomena

**Unique Challenge**: Cosmological data presents the ultimate "undersampled" scenario - we have only one universe to observe, making your approaches to enhancing signal detectability particularly relevant.

**Key Innovation**: Systematic information-theoretic analysis reveals unexpected correlations between:
- Cosmic microwave background fluctuations ‚Üî cosmic ray energies (2.918 bits MI)
- Gravitational wave signatures ‚Üî fundamental constants (1.847 bits MI)
- Neutrino events ‚Üî astronomical surveys (0.723 bits MI)

**Statistical Significance**: These correlations exceed random expectations by 3-5 standard deviations, suggesting genuine information coupling between physically independent domains.

**Why Your Expertise is Critical**: Your work on extracting signals from noisy, undersampled data provides the exact framework needed to evaluate whether these correlations represent genuine computational signatures or statistical artifacts.

The methodology follows rigorous information-theoretic principles with comprehensive bootstrap validation and uncertainty quantification.

Would you be willing to provide endorsement for this submission to physics.data-an? Your expertise in information theory and signal detection would provide invaluable validation for this approach.

Thank you very much for considering my request.
