## 🚨 **Risk Mitigation**

### **Potential Issues & Solutions**

**Issue 1: LaTeX Formatting Problems**
- **Risk**: Compilation errors or formatting issues
- **Mitigation**: Use Overleaf for reliable LaTeX environment
- **Backup**: Have simplified version ready if complex formatting fails

**Issue 2: arXiv Moderation Delay/Rejection**
- **Risk**: Submission held for review or rejected
- **Mitigation**: Follow arXiv guidelines precisely, prepare response to feedback
- **Backup**: Alternative preprint servers (bioRxiv, ResearchGate)

**Issue 3: File Size/Format Issues**
- **Risk**: Figures too large or wrong format
- **Mitigation**: Test all files before submission, compress if needed
- **Backup**: Simplified figures that meet requirements

**Issue 4: Author/Affiliation Questions**
- **Risk**: Institutional approval or co-author consent issues
- **Mitigation**: Ensure all permissions before submission
- **Backup**: Individual submission with proper disclaimers
