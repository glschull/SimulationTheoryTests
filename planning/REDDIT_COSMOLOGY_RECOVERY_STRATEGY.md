# üö® r/cosmology Moderator Removal - Recovery Strategy

## ‚ùå **What Happened**
Your r/cosmology post was removed by moderators, likely due to:

1. **New account** with insufficient karma/history
2. **"Simulation hypothesis" content** seen as too speculative for academic cosmology  
3. **External links** (GitHub) flagged as self-promotion
4. **Content scope** - may be viewed as outside mainstream cosmology research

## üîÑ **Recovery Plan**

### **IMMEDIATE: Do NOT Repost**
- **Reposting immediately** = automatic ban
- **Wait at least 1 week** before any cosmology subreddit contact
- **Build credibility first** through other communities

### **Step 1: Polite Moderator Contact (Optional)**

**Message to r/cosmology moderators:**
```
Subject: Request for feedback on removed post

Hello r/cosmology moderators,

I recently posted about cross-domain correlation analysis in cosmological data, and I see it was removed. I'm a self-taught physics enthusiast working on empirical testing of fundamental questions using real observational data.

Could you provide feedback on what specifically violated community guidelines? I'd like to understand how to better contribute to this community in the future.

I'm working with public datasets from Planck, LIGO, Pierre Auger, etc., using standard statistical methods to analyze correlations across different cosmological phenomena.

Would reframing this as "information structure analysis in cosmological data" be more appropriate for this community?

Thank you for your time and for maintaining the quality of this subreddit.

Best regards,

### **Step 2: Alternative Cosmology Communities (Better Options)**

#### **r/AskPhysics** (More Open to Theoretical Work)
- **Audience**: Physics students and researchers
- **Content**: Theoretical discussions welcome
- **Karma requirements**: Low
- **Approach**: Frame as physics methodology question

**Title**: "Statistical methods for detecting unexpected correlations in cosmological datasets?"

#### **r/PhysicsStudents** (Educational Focus)
- **Audience**: Physics students learning cosmology
- **Content**: Educational discussions encouraged
- **Karma requirements**: None
- **Approach**: Educational post about cross-domain analysis

**Title**: "Cross-domain analysis in cosmology: Finding patterns across CMB, cosmic rays, and gravitational waves"

#### **r/TheoreticalPhysics** (Speculative Theories Welcome)
- **Audience**: Theoretical physicists
- **Content**: Speculative physics theories
- **Karma requirements**: Low
- **Approach**: Theoretical framework discussion

**Title**: "Empirical framework for testing information structure in cosmological phenomena"

#### **r/AskScienceDiscussion** (General Science Discussion)
- **Audience**: Science enthusiasts and researchers
- **Content**: Broad scientific discussions
- **Karma requirements**: None
- **Approach**: Open scientific discussion

**Title**: "Testing for computational signatures in cosmological data - methodology discussion"

## üéØ **Revised Content Strategy**

### **Avoid These Terms in Cosmology Communities:**
- ‚ùå "Simulation hypothesis"
- ‚ùå "Simulation theory" 
- ‚ùå "Digital physics"
- ‚ùå "Computational universe"
- ‚ùå "Testing if we live in a simulation"

### **Use These Technical Alternatives:**
- ‚úÖ "Cross-domain correlation analysis"
- ‚úÖ "Information structure in cosmological data"
- ‚úÖ "Statistical dependencies in observational cosmology"
- ‚úÖ "Empirical testing of fundamental physics"
- ‚úÖ "Anomaly detection in multi-domain datasets"

### **Revised r/cosmology Approach (For Future)**

**Title**: "Cross-domain statistical dependencies in cosmological observations - unexpected correlations found"

**Opening**: 
```
I've been analyzing correlations across different cosmological datasets and found some unexpected statistical dependencies that I'd like the community's input on.

**Data sources**: Planck CMB, Pierre Auger cosmic rays, LIGO gravitational waves, astronomical surveys

**Finding**: These domains show statistically significant correlations (1.2-2.9 bits mutual information) despite being physically independent according to ŒõCDM.

**Question**: What cosmological mechanisms could explain information sharing between these independent phenomena?
```

## üöÄ **Immediate Action Plan**

### **Today (Build Credibility)**
1. **Go to r/explainlikeimfive** - answer 2-3 cosmology questions
2. **Browse r/AskPhysics** - help with cosmology homework questions
3. **Check r/PhysicsStudents** - provide educational insights

### **This Week (Establish Presence)**
1. **Post to r/AskPhysics** with methodology question
2. **Share educational content** on r/PhysicsStudents
3. **Build comment karma** through helpful physics answers
4. **Avoid cosmology-specific subreddits** until established

### **Next Week (Re-approach Cosmology)**
1. **Try r/TheoreticalPhysics** with revised framing
2. **Post to r/AskScienceDiscussion** with open question format
3. **Return to r/cosmology** only after 50+ karma and established account

## üí° **Alternative Success Strategy**

### **Physics Forums Route**
- **PhysicsForums.com**: Academic physics discussion
- **Higher tolerance** for speculative but rigorous work
- **No karma requirements**
- **Direct engagement** with cosmology researchers

### **Twitter Academic Route**
- **Academic Twitter**: Direct connection to cosmology researchers
- **Thread your findings** using technical language
- **Tag relevant researchers** (politely)
- **Build academic network** first

### **ResearchGate/Academia.edu Route**
- **Upload methodology paper** to academic platforms
- **Share link carefully** on Reddit after establishing presence
- **Build academic credibility** first

## üéØ **Success Timeline**

### **Week 1**: Karma building + alternative communities
### **Week 2**: Established account + broader physics discussions  
### **Week 3**: Return to cosmology with credibility
### **Week 4**: Academic platform integration

## ‚ö†Ô∏è **Critical Lessons**

1. **Reddit cosmology is VERY conservative** - stick to mainstream topics initially
2. **New accounts are heavily scrutinized** - build history first
3. **"Simulation" is a trigger word** - avoid in academic communities
4. **External links require established accounts** - build karma before sharing GitHub

**The key: Establish yourself as a helpful, knowledgeable physics contributor BEFORE introducing controversial topics.**

**Remember: This is a temporary setback, not a failure. Your research is solid - it just needs the right presentation and platform! üéØ**
