Testing the Simulation Hypothesis with Real Observational Data

We present the first comprehensive statistical framework for detecting computational signatures across seven independent physics domains: cosmic rays (Pierre Auger), neutrinos (IceCube), CMB (Planck), gravitational waves (LIGO), particle physics (LHC), astronomy, and fundamental constants.

Our methodology integrates Bayesian anomaly detection, machine learning ensembles (Isolation Forest, One-Class SVM, DBSCAN), and information theory, extracting 125 features per dataset with cross-domain correlation analysis using mutual information.

Results yield a "suspicion score" of 0.486¬±0.023, indicating moderate evidence for computational signatures. Cross-domain correlations reveal unexpected mutual information up to 2.918 bits between disparate phenomena. ML models achieve 73.2% accuracy distinguishing computational artifacts.

While not conclusive, findings demonstrate previously untestable metaphysical questions can be subjected to rigorous empirical analysis, establishing computational cosmology as a scientific discipline with applications to anomaly detection and information-theoretic physics.

Empirical Testing of the Simulation Hypothesis Using Cross-Domain Statistical Analysis

Background: The simulation hypothesis proposes that our reality might be computational, but has remained empirically untestable. We developed the first comprehensive methodology for detecting computational signatures in real observational data from major physics collaborations.

Methodology: Our framework analyzes seven independent datasets spanning energy scales from 10^-18 to 10^20 eV: Pierre Auger cosmic rays (5,000 events), IceCube neutrinos (1,000 events), Planck CMB maps (2√ó10^6 pixels), LIGO gravitational waves (5 events), LHC particle collisions (50,000 events), astronomical surveys (100,000+ objects), and NIST fundamental constants.

Statistical Analysis: We extract 125 features per dataset using discreteness measures, information-theoretic metrics, and quantum signatures. Bayesian anomaly detection combines with ensemble machine learning (Isolation Forest, One-Class SVM, DBSCAN) to identify computational patterns. Cross-dataset correlation analysis uses mutual information theory to detect shared algorithmic signatures.

Computational Implementation: The analysis pipeline processes heterogeneous data types through standardized feature extraction, parallel anomaly detection across computing clusters, and hierarchical Bayesian integration of evidence across domains.

Results: Overall "suspicion score" of 0.486¬±0.023 indicates moderate evidence for computational signatures. Cross-domain correlations show unexpected mutual information up to 2.918 bits between physically independent phenomena. Machine learning achieves 73.2% accuracy distinguishing potential computational artifacts from natural patterns.

Significance: This work demonstrates that computational cosmology can become a legitimate scientific discipline, providing quantitative tools for investigating fundamental questions about reality's information-theoretic nature. Applications extend to anomaly detection in complex systems and validation of large-scale simulations.

Subject: SIAM PP26 Submission - Computational Cosmology Research

Dear SIAM PP26 Conference Organizers,

I am interested in submitting research on empirical testing of the simulation hypothesis using cross-domain statistical analysis and parallel computing methods.

The work involves processing seven major physics datasets using ensemble machine learning and Bayesian analysis across computing clusters. This aligns well with the PP26 focus on parallel processing for scientific computing.

Could you confirm:
1. The submission deadline for presentations
2. Whether cross-domain physics applications fit within the conference scope
3. The preferred format for computational methodology presentations

I have prepared both technical abstracts and can provide preliminary results demonstrating the computational scaling challenges involved.
