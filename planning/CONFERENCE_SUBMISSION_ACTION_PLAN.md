## üìù **Draft APS Abstract (1,300 Character Version)**

### **Working Draft** (Needs compression)
```
Testing the Simulation Hypothesis with Real Observational Data

We present the first comprehensive statistical framework for detecting computational signatures in real observational data across seven independent physics domains: cosmic rays (Pierre Auger), neutrinos (IceCube), CMB (Planck), gravitational waves (LIGO), particle physics (LHC), astronomy, and fundamental constants (NIST).

Our methodology integrates Bayesian anomaly detection, machine learning ensembles, and information theory, extracting 125 features per dataset and computing cross-domain correlations using mutual information analysis.

Results yield a "suspicion score" of 0.486¬±0.023, indicating moderate evidence for computational signatures. Cross-domain correlations reveal unexpected mutual information up to 2.918 bits between disparate phenomena. ML models achieve 73.2% accuracy distinguishing potential computational artifacts.

While not conclusive, findings demonstrate that previously untestable metaphysical questions can be subjected to rigorous empirical analysis, establishing computational cosmology as a scientific discipline.

Significance: Transforms philosophical speculation into empirical science with applications to anomaly detection and information-theoretic physics.
