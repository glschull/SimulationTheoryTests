Subject: APS March Meeting 2026 Abstract Submission Timeline Inquiry

Dear APS Abstract Help Team,

I am preparing to submit an abstract for the APS March Meeting 2026 on computational methods for testing the simulation hypothesis using real observational data.

Could you please provide:

1. When will abstract submission open for March Meeting 2026?
2. What is the submission deadline?
3. Are there specific sessions for computational physics/statistical methods?
4. Any updates on the meeting location and dates?

I have reviewed the submission guidelines and prepared a 1,295-character abstract meeting all requirements. I am [completing APS membership/am an APS member] and ready to submit once the portal opens.

Thank you for your assistance.

Best regards,
[Name]
[Institution/Affiliation]
[Phone Number]
[Email]

- [ ] Identify typical submission opening/closing dates
- [ ] Research session organization for computational physics
- [ ] Check APS calendar and announcements

#### **Step 3: Alternative Research Methods (15 minutes)**

- [ ] Check submission deadline and timeline
- [ ] Research session organization and tracks

#### **Step 2: Conference Scope Validation (30 minutes)**
- [ ] Review previous PP26 proceedings for similar topics
- [ ] Check if cross-domain physics applications fit scope
- [ ] Assess computational methods emphasis vs. physics results
- [ ] Evaluate audience alignment with our methodology

#### **Step 3: Logistics Research (15 minutes)**
- [ ] Check registration costs and early bird deadlines
- [ ] Research Berlin venue and travel requirements
- [ ] Compare timeline with APS March Meeting dates
- [ ] Evaluate conference prestige and networking value

### **Task 4: Abstract Refinement & Submission Prep (60 minutes)**

#### **Step 1: Final Abstract Polish (30 minutes)**
- [ ] Review APS abstract one more time for optimization
- [ ] Verify character count and formatting
- [ ] Check for any technical accuracy improvements
- [ ] Prepare co-author information if applicable

#### **Step 2: Submission Materials Preparation (30 minutes)**
- [ ] Prepare presentation preference justification
- [ ] Draft session selection rationale
- [ ] Create author affiliation information
- [ ] Prepare any required supporting documentation

## ðŸš¨ **Risk Mitigation Planning**

### **Potential Issues & Solutions**

**Issue 1: APS Membership Delay**
- **Risk**: Membership processing takes 48+ hours
- **Mitigation**: Apply immediately, contact membership@aps.org for expedited processing
- **Backup**: Research reciprocal society options, contact institution

**Issue 2: 2026 Timeline Not Available**
- **Risk**: March Meeting 2026 details not yet released
- **Mitigation**: Use historical patterns, set up alerts for announcements
- **Backup**: Focus on SIAM PP26 and other 2025 conferences first

**Issue 3: SIAM PP26 Scope Mismatch**
- **Risk**: Conference doesn't accept cross-domain physics applications
- **Mitigation**: Contact organizers directly, emphasize computational methods
- **Backup**: Research additional computational conferences (IEEE, ACM)
