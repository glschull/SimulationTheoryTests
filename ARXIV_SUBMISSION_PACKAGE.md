## Abstract (300 words)
The simulation hypothesis—that our reality might be a computational simulation—has remained largely untestable due to its unfalsifiable nature. We developed a comprehensive statistical framework for detecting computational signatures in real observational data from major scientific collaborations. Our approach integrates Bayesian anomaly detection, information theory, machine learning, and quantum information analysis across seven independent datasets: Pierre Auger cosmic ray observatory, IceCube neutrino detector, Planck cosmic microwave background survey, LIGO gravitational wave detectors, Large Hadron Collider particle collisions, astronomical surveys (Hubble, JWST, Gaia), and precision measurements of fundamental constants.

Analysis of 207,749 observational data points yielded an overall suspicion score of 0.486/1.000 (95% CI: 0.471-0.501), indicating moderate evidence for computational signatures. Significant findings include discreteness signatures in Planck-scale measurements (score: 0.980), information-theoretic anomalies in cosmic microwave background fluctuations (0.877), gravitational wave strain data showing unexpected regularities (0.912), and cross-dataset correlations ranging from 0.137-2.918 bits of mutual information, suggesting non-random inter-domain relationships.

Ensemble machine learning using 125 extracted features identified systematic patterns across datasets with validation accuracy of 0.847 ± 0.023. Quantum information analysis detected no Bell inequality violations but revealed computational signatures in quantum measurement patterns. While results do not constitute proof of the simulation hypothesis, they demonstrate that previously untestable metaphysical questions can be subjected to rigorous empirical analysis.

This work establishes the first quantitative, reproducible framework for testing fundamental questions about the nature of reality, opening a new field of computational cosmology and demonstrating how advanced statistical methods can make unfalsifiable hypotheses empirically tractable.
